# CHAOSS Badging Event submission guidelines

## General guidelines
- Make sure all the [requirements](./requirements.md) are fulfilled before initiating a CHAOSS Badging application.
- Timely integrate reviewers' feedback while the CHAOSS Badging application is being evaluated.

## Application guide
1. Navigate to [the CHAOSS Event Badging submission form](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/)
2. Fill out the web form to your best ability and click "Submit" on the web form.
4. An issue template will be created for you with the information you provided. Click "Create New Issue" to begin the application.
5. Communicate with the reviewers during the process and provide Event information according to the metrics your event committed to.
6. Your event will be assessed by at least two reviewers, and a badge will be generated for you.
7. The review ends when a maintainer confirms that the initial checks are met. You will be asked if you are ok with the badge assigned, and you will have the opportunity to make any changes before the badge is officially issued. 
8. The issue is closed and the badge is generated using `/end` command in a comment by a maintainer.
