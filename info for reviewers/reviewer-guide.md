# Reviewer Guide

Welcome! You are also affectionately known as "Badgers" so you may see that term being used. :smile:

## Working with checklists

A CHAOSS Badging application starts when an Applicant opens an issue on the [event](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion) badging repository. They fill out a form to create a GitHub issue, which contains the information a reviewer looks at. 

The steps for completing a review are as follows: 
1. Upon being assigned an issue, you will have the opportunity to decide if you are available for the review. If you check *no*, another reviewer will be assigned.  
2. If you check *yes*, a checklist will be created for you in the form of a comment. (A separate checklist is created for each reviewer.)
3. Your task is to read through the answers provided from the applicant and verify the information. Then you can determine if a checkbox should be checked for that specific topic.
4. Feel free to @-mention the applicant for questions, feedback or for further clarification on any point. This is meant to be an open and friendly discourse between reviewer and applicant.
5. When you are finished with your review, use the command -done to notify the maintainer that your review is complete.


## Guidelines

For all submissions:
  - Make sure the Initial checks are met. These are the basic requirements which help to ensure that the application is at a bare minimum standard.
  - Mark your observations according to the Review Checklist, and give feedback on how an application can be improved if certain checks are not met.
  - If you have feedback outside of the scope of what the review checklist asks for, create a new comment informing the applicant about that.

For Events:
  - Currently, there are five metrics which can be applied for by an Event Badging applicant.
  - Event badges are assigned according to four Badge levels.
  - Event reviews go on until all the metrics the Applicant gave their statement for qualify all the given checks. For example, if an applicant gave their statement for adhering to Code of Conduct and Speaker Demographic metrics (which form the first metric set), their Badge status would be pending until the qualitative checks related to both these metrics are passed.
